        Our project is a Minecraft server that hosts the game on the server so
        that players can play online together through a local area network. The
        server includes many different plugins that players can use which change
        the way that the game is played and changes the way the game looks. Mods
        also add content to the game including new bricks and characters
        enabling players to create new worlds or play the game in different game
        modes. We have implemented a backup strategy that saves data so that
        data can be restored if needed.

        Minecraft is a game that is made up of blocks and creatures. You can
        survive the night with all the creatures or build any world you would
        like to create. Plugins and mods can be added to the game which enable
        players to expand the items and characters in the game. This enables
        more game modes to be played. Minecraft can be played with many other
        users on a network as well.
